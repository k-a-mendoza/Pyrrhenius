.. Pyrrhenius documentation

Welcome to the Documentation for **Pyrrhenius v1.0**  
====================
**Pyrrhenius** (Python-Arrhenius) is a Python library for manipulating electric conductivity models of minerals and melts. Developed out of necessity to interpret million+ parameter Magnetotelluric inversions, where simple 1D bounds of mineral conductance, Pyrrhenius provides *mostly* vectorized python mathematical models of
electrical conductance. Each model has been verified and adjusted as much as possible to correspond to the empirical fits described in its originating publication.
